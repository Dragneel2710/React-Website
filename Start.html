        <p>View : </p>
        <P>The View is the fundamental component of React Native for building a user interface. 
            It is a container that supports layout with flexbox, style, touch handling, and accessibility controls. 
            It maps directly to the native view similar to whatever platform on React Native app is running on.

        <p>Text : </p>
        <p>A React component for displaying text. 
            Text supports nesting, styling, and touch handling. 
            In the following example, the nested title and body text will inherit the fontFamily from styles.

    <div>
        <p>Button : </p>
        <p> Buttons are touchable elements used to interact with the screen. 
            They may display text, icons, or both. 
            Buttons can be styled with several props to look a specific way.
